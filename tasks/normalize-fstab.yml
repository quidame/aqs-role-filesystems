# Tasks to normalize /etc/fstab.


# '/foo/bar' and '/foo/bar/' don't match. That's all. And neither kernel nor
# system tools will show directory paths with trailing slashes. So the mount
# module, with path=/foo/bar and path=/foo/bar/ will create 2 records for
# the same device, and finally the same mountpoint... Don't worry, this will
# leave rootfs record (/) untouched.

# - Replace /dev/VG/LV by /dev/mapper/VG-LV ? `mount` module will do it.
